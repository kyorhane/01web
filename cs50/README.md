CS50: The Final Project

For my final project, I created a webapp that allows users to create a personal profile page
built on top of the distribution code provided by CS50. My webapp aims to fill the need for individuals
who want to have a styled and personalized profile webpage dedicated to them. Users will be able to paste the  link to this profile page in their social media bio section - which is available on most platforms but has a limit of characters. So by using my webapp, they can share more about their interests and hobbies - all in one place without having to worry about character limits.
